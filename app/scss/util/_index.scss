/*
   Use `@forward` to re-export styles from other files/modules.
   This helps in organizing the project by splitting it into smaller, reusable parts.
   Any file importing this file will have access to all forwarded modules.
*/

@forward 'breakpoints';  // Forward breakpoints for responsive design
@forward 'functions';    // Forward utility functions (e.g., rem conversion)

/*
   Explanation:
   1. `@forward` is part of the Sass module system. It allows re-exporting styles from other Sass files.
   2. This approach promotes modularity by grouping related styles into separate files.
   3. Files importing this module don't need to import each individual file separatelyâ€”they inherit all forwarded content.

   Example usage:
   In a main file (e.g., `main.scss`), you can simply do:
   @use 'settings';
   All variables, functions, and mixins forwarded by 'settings' will be accessible.
