/*
   Benefits of using mixins:
   -------------------------
   1. **Code reusability**: Instead of writing repetitive media queries, we use mixins with predefined breakpoints.
   2. **Maintainability**: If we ever need to update the breakpoint values, we only need to change them in one place.
   3. **Readability**: Using @include makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

   Additional Notes:
   -----------------
   - The **@content** directive in the mixin allows the block of CSS code passed by @include to be inserted at that location.
   - The use of **em** units ensures that the breakpoints are scalable and relative to the root font size.
