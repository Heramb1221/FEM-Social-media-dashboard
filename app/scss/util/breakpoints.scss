/* Instead of using media queries directly throughout the codebase like:
   @media (min-width: 50em) { ... }
   we can use **breakpoints** and **mixins** to make the code reusable,
   easier to maintain, and more consistent.

   Mixins are reusable code blocks that can be included multiple times wherever needed.
*/

/* Define breakpoints for "up" media queries (min-width values) */
$breakpoints-up: (
    'medium': '40em',  // Medium screens: 640px and above
    'large': '64em',   // Large screens: 1024px and above
    'xlarge': '87.5em' // Extra large screens: 1400px and above
);

/* Define breakpoints for "down" media queries (max-width values) */
$breakpoints-down: (
    'small': '39.9375em',   // Small screens: Up to 639px
    'medium': '63.9375em',  // Medium screens: Up to 1023px

/*
   Define a mixin for "up" media queries using the breakpoints-up map.
   This mixin will apply styles when the screen width is greater than or equal to the specified size.
*/
@mixin breakpoint($size) {
    @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints-up, $size)) {
        @content; // This allows the mixin to accept a block of code to execute.
    }
}

/*
   Define a mixin for "down" media queries using the breakpoints-down map.
   This mixin will apply styles when the screen width is less than or equal to the specified size.
*/
@mixin breakpoint-down($size) {
    @media (max-width: map-get($breakpoints-down, $size)) {
        @content;
    }
}

/*
   To use the mixin, we use the @include directive with the desired breakpoint size.

   Example usage:
   -----------------
   If we want to apply a larger font size for <h1> elements on large screens:
*/
/*
h1 {
    @include breakpoint(large) {
        font-size: 3rem; // Increase font size for screens >= 1024px
    }
}
*/
/*
   Benefits of using mixins:
   -------------------------
   1. **Code reusability**: Instead of writing repetitive media queries, we use mixins with predefined breakpoints.
   2. **Maintainability**: If we ever need to update the breakpoint values, we only need to change them in one place.
   3. **Readability**: Using @include makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

   Additional Notes:
   -----------------
   - The **@content** directive in the mixin allows the block of CSS code passed by @include to be inserted at that location.
   - The use of **em** units ensures that the breakpoints are scalable and relative to the root font size.
